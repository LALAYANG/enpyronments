About enpyronments
===================

enpyronments is a configuration management library that helps you separate your
configuration from your code, while also letting you use Python to define your
settings.

Currently, this project is just me, while I get things started up. Soon, I'll
be looking for other contributors, so feel free to reach out to me on GitHub
if you're interested in helping this project!
